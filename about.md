Joseph Camacho-Roy is a student at The Academy of Science and Entreprenuership. When he's not working on his 20 percent time project, he is probably watching anime or playing "OSU!". Joseph is the founder of the anime club at ASE. He is happily employed at the Monroe County Public Library where he regularly hosts video game tournaments. He created this blog thanks in part to the technical expertise of his best friend [Owen Walters](http://www.github.com/10by10pixel). If you have any questions about this blog or Joseph feel free to contact him at joseph@celiasky.co.
