Hello and welcome back!

This is supposed to be my midway report on my project. The thing is, my project has changed so many times so I don't really have much to report about an individual project. But, I will recap the journey I've taken so far, and what comes next for me.

So, starting from the beginning, way back in February, my initial project was to create design mockups for various local companies (or really anyone that needed one). These design mockups would be something like a website or an app, or possibly something else that they would request. Unfortunately, this wasn't exactly was I wanted to do, so it never stayed very high on my priority list. That's not to say that it was something I hated, it just wasn't what I was picturing, so I lost motivation and the work didn't get done.

Around the last week before spring break, the first week of March, some issues were dealt with. I'm not going to recap the whole thing, as it was a lot of factors, but you can read the post about it [here][reality]. Basically, our class was all struggling with the interest of our projects, and we were all very behind in our projects. So, as a group, everyone decided it was fair to "restart" our projects and modify them in a way that would keep our interest. Some people didn't modify theirs, others did. I was one of the "others," and my project went from designing graphics for others to creating a graphic-novel-mixed-with-UI like project.

Finally, we arrive on Wednesday, April 6th: the last and final day I decide to change my project. That day, my project changes from creating a graphic-novel-mixed-with-UI like project to creating materials for incoming freshmen to help them get used to our school. Now, that sounds like a big change, doesn't it? Well, that's correct, but it's a little different than you might think. This project was actually the project of a friend and classmate of mine. Now, it's **our** project. Yes, we decided to pair up. For the most part, he will be working on the content, i.e. what will be put in the final product and I will be in charge of taking that content and designing the product. So, I'm still doing design work, just in a slightly different way.

Now, you may be wondering why I decided to drop my other project. Well, it was for two main reasons, the first being that my old project was too ambitious. I think the project was a great and original idea, it was just going to be too much to handle in the time I had. Now, if I had started at the beginning with that idea, things may have been different, but alas, that was not the case. The second reason was that I believe it will be easier to create a product that I can be proud of with the new project. When I say easier, I mean time wise. The last project could've been doable, but I was having a serious case of writers/designers block, and who knows when that would've ended. Once it did, I would've had to hustle to get my project done, and I believe that would've impacted my health, grades, and enjoyment significantly (because of the high probability of many hours of lost sleep). With the new project, I feel like it is just more *doable*. I have a partner to rely on if I need help as well, which is something that really sets me at ease, and I'm sure my partner feels the same. We've created plans and everything to help us keep on track as much as possible, and are communicating frequently. I think we have a lot of potential to create something amazing.

So, I think my time has finally come. It's been a long journey to get here, but here I am. 

I'm ready to create something awesome.

Cheers,

Joseph Camacho-Roy
