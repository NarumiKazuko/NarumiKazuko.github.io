*3... 2... 1...*

Welcome back to my blog! Today, I'm going to be discussing the LAUNCH cycle. For those who don't know what the LAUNCH cycle is, here's a quick rundown:

>L: Look, Listen, and Learn
>In the first phase, students look, listen, and learn. The goal here is awareness. It might be a sense of wonder at a process or an awareness of a problem or a sense of empathy toward an audience.
>
>A: Ask Tons of Questions
>Sparked by curiosity, students move to the second phase, where they ask tons of questions.
>
>U: Understanding the Process or Problem
>This leads to understanding the process or problem through an authentic research experience. They might conduct interviews or needs assessments, research articles, watch videos, or analyze data.
>
>N: Navigate Ideas
>Students apply that newly acquired knowledge to potential solutions. In this phase, they navigate ideas. Here they not only brainstorm, but they also analyze ideas, combine ideas, and generate a concept for what they will create.
>
>C: Create a Prototype
>In this next phase, they create a prototype. It might be a digital work or a tangible product, a work of art or something they engineer. It might even be an action or an event or a system.
>
>H: Highlight and Fix
>Next, they begin to highlight what’s working and fix what’s failing. The goal here is to view this revision process as an experiment full of iterations, where every mistake takes them closer to success.
>
>Launch to an Audience
>
>Then, when it’s done, it’s ready to launch. In the launch phase, they send it to an authentic audience. They share their work with the world!

Now that you know what it is, you might be wondering why I'm discussing this. Well, this week has been a hard one. I didn't achieve as much as I wished to, partly due to the fact that I was sick, and partly due to my own shortcomings. I think this was due to me not having a solid guide or structure for my project. I have benchmarks, which tell me *when things need to be done*, but benchmarks don't give me a structure on *how to do them*. See the difference?

If I had to guess, I would probably be in-between steps A and U. I'm just about to ask my potential clients if they want to become *actual* clients, and what they would want if they do become a clients. Once I get my answers, I can really start with my project. While I wait for the answers, I will be practicing various techniques in the software I'll be using to get used to things and maybe pickup a few tricks too.

Here's to successful weeks going forward!
