Hello and welcome back!

This week, my partner and I have mostly been working on completing the content of the project. He's in charge of most of it, since I'll be doing all the design work, but I'm still helping out with a few sections as well as finding videos that are relevant to the content. I'm a huge fan of TED Talks, so most of the videos are TED Talks. I've also been working on some design drafts for the PowerPoint and web design, and I'm just about ready to start actually creating it. Hopefully sometime next week I'll be able to start putting the content in and get us closer to a first draft.

Sorry the post is so short this week; there's not much to say or show other than the content in its raw form, so I figured that I'd just wait until next week. I should have an actual start to the project by then, meaning that the files will actually exist. Maybe you'll get some sneak-peak visuals too!

Cheers,

Joseph Camacho-Roy
