Hello and welcome back!

This week has been huge for my project. The content is very close to being completed; it's about 90% done currently. Once the last few sections are completed and it gets edited, it'll basically be ready for insertion into the product. Awesome! Another big thing that's happened for the project this week is the actual product. I've been working on the storyboard, which is nearly complete now. That means that this weekend, which is a four-day weekend for me, I can translate the storyboard into a first-draft of the product. A *very real, very tangible* first-draft. Yes, it will actually exist!

Sorry for the short post again. As stated before, this week has mostly been completing the content and storyboard. But, before I sign off, here's a picture of the storyboard in progress:

Pretty neat, if I do say so myself.

Cheers,
