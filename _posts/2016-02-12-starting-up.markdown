Hello again!

Welcome to my second post regarding my 20% time project! You can read my first one right [here][test-test].

This time, I'm going to be discussing starting my project. I'm going to be honest, starting things is hard for me. Whether it's my homework, a show, a project, whatever, I always struggle taking the first step. Based on [this][test] article I read, there are four major obstacles that prevents one from starting things: fear, avoidance, motivation, and having no map. Most of the time, I fall into the fear and motivation category. I either have a fear of looking stupid, that it won't work, that I'll spend a lot of time for nothing, etc. or no motivation/too much motivation (which burns me out too fast) to start.<

These things are something I want to improve, which will require working on them over time. Unfortunately, there's no quick fix for me. But, I'm working on it, and this project will help me improve as well. I have my benchmarks down, I'm emailing my potential clients very soon, and I'm working on a solution to the lack of resources, which is honestly much more planning than I normally do for a project. If all goes well for this project, I'm going to use this experience to better myself down the line.<

Let's aim for the top!
