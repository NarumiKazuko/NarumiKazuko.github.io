Hello and welcome back!

It appears I've reached a fork in the road with my project. I've come to two possible pathways, the first being...

Continue going the same way I have been. Continue working on my mix of a graphic novel, graphic deign, and story-telling. Now, as a disclaimer, I have absolutely no problems with that project. I think it's a really unique and original idea, and I've been enjoying working on it. I have some drafts of the potential designs and how they would flow (not something I can show off yet though), and I have ideas for the story as well. So, I'm in an alright position for my original project, and I could potentially continue on that path, or...

Start working with a class-mate. His project is to create materials to help new students get used to how our school works, and to help them learn to be organized. He's creating a guide of sorts, and also possibly materials like a planner. The idea was that he would handle the content, like how things would look and what to put in it, and I would be the one handling the creation of the materials. Basically, I contracted to work for him and design his stuff. That sounds so official, doesn't it? Now, nothing is official yet. He expressed interest, but no official plans are set yet. I send a message to him, and I'm awaiting his response.

I think I can make a good product no matter which pathway I end up taking. I can't deny that I currently want to work with him more, but either way, I think stuff's looking good! Next week, I'll update again on which way I went.

Cheers,

Joseph Camacho-Roy
