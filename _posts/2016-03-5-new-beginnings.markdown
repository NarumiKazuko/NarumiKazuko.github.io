Hello and welcome back!

As you may be able to tell by the title, something is happening.

Yes, I am restarting my project.

Not just restarting either, I'm choosing something completely different. The reason for this is a story longer than I can really put in a concise blog post, so I'll just give the quick run-down. Basically, there were work-ethic problems on my side, and some other issues coming from some other factors and they all culminated into a big mess. I'm keeping the issues vague because, to be honest, I'm not exactly sure what all the factors were. So many things were happening around that time that I can't recall it all perfectly. Anyway, after the issues combined, we ended up having a talk with our teacher about the recent events. It was an honest talk, which is something that I don't often have with teachers. We came to the conclusion that for me, a different project would be the best course of action, as my old project wasn't *really* the project I wanted to do.

So, what's my new project? Well, it's not finalized yet as I have some things to decide on still, but the most likely idea right now is creating a "graphic novel" of sorts with the panels as the interface of a chatting website (something like Facebook, Twitter, or an IRC). I would tell the story through the UI, which would let me flex my graphic design muscle, as well as my writing one. Writing and linguistics has always been something that's interesting to me, and I really wanted to do a project with them, but I never have. I guess that's about to change!

Now, things aren't final, but they're close. I'm glad most of the issues have been dealt with, or at least addressed. Spring break is coming up, so that'll give me some good time to work on the story and possibly the roughs of the UI.

It looks like I'm back in the black.

Cheers,

Joseph Camacho-Roy
